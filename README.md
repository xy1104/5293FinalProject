Grab and visual analysis of any movie short reviews (hits) as well as their scores from the websites IMDb (America)and douban (China). The data will contain movie names, popularity,runtime,vote and other information. We will do the Data Cleaning first.
The core of our project is to uncover the needs of users who watch movies, so one of the central questions is: What are the needs of users that can be uncovered from the data? The data used in this case study are the box office data of 1664 movies from Douban and top 700 movies from IMDB and the factors that influence them, including the year of the movie, the length of the movie, the genre of the movie, the score of the movie on two different websites and the number of ratings, etc. Movie box office can be affected by various factors, such as the length of the movie, the amounts of people views, the type of movie, the era in which the movie was produced, the budget of the movie, and so on. In this project, we will focus on the analysis of the the relation between rating and reviews, the tendency of genre and whether there has a significant difference of rating on different websites.
