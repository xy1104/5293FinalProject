Film works have become a symbol of a trend that increasingly enriches our daily life.At the same time, nowadays, during the epidemic, people need to work from home more often, greatly increasing the time for self-arrangement, and more people choose to watch movies in their leisure time. We chose this topic for project was because that we both used to go to the movies and all experienced doubts: Why are there more venues for some movies? Why film genres changed over time? What controllable factors are associated with box office? Does the rating of a movie correlate with the number of people watching or reviewing it? The more people review and rate these movies, the more popular they are, the higher the rating they receive? Do movie ratings differ significantly on different movie sites? In fact, this is some of the questions we want to solve through data analysis that come from life. The audience will score and leave comments on the platform after watching a movie, and the pre-sale, scheduling and attendance of each movie are all data. Through data analysis, we can predict the box office of movies, evaluate the precise marketing of film makers and theaters, and predict the quality movies recommended by websites and APPs for the audience. The core of our project is to uncover the needs of users who watch movies, so one of the central questions is: What are the needs of users that can be uncovered from the data? The data used in this case study are the box office data of 1664 movies from Douban and top 700 movies from IMDB and the factors that influence them, including the year of the movie, the length of the movie, the genre of the movie, the score of the movie on two different websites and the number of ratings, etc. Movie box office can be affected by various factors, such as the length of the movie, the amounts of people views, the type of movie, the era in which the movie was produced, the budget of the movie, and so on. In this project, we will focus on the analysis of the the relation between rating and reviews, the tendency of genre and whether there has a significant difference of rating on different websites. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Data source: 2.2 Collecting Data 2.3 Basic information about the dataset. 2.4 Issues 2.5 Links", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Data source: We will retrieve data from websites IMDb (America)and douban (China). The data for this report comes from the film data resources. Grab and visual analysis of any movie short reviews (hits) as well as their scores from the websites IMDb (America)and douban (China). The data will contain movie IDs, genre, popularity, runtime, vote and other informations. We will do the Data Cleaning first. 2.2 Collecting Data Since our final project wants to answer the question from two movie markets, China and America, it was separated into two parts naturally. Hence, we collected data separately (Shiang dynamicly web scraped data from douban, and Long dynamicly web scraped data from IMDB), and later we did the same research and answer the same questions with different counties’ movie data. If there were a choice of option, we might choose some other database sites that provide ready-made raw data. This is because fetching web data was a painful process, not only that some website have anti - crawling mechanism for which the layout of the web interface changes at regular intervals so that we cannot use previous existing codes to retrieve the data, but also that we need long time to store our data into the csv files we wrote. For instance, we both spent long time due to any web pages are very different from where the data is on the next page. For IMDB, the link we use is with the code of JavaScript displayed written in confusion, for which it has so many repetitive classes which prevents us from quickly selecting the parts we need. Especially for douban, a website with a mix of languages, we spent about 2 hours for just stored the data and 2 more hours for translating all the languages from raw data into English. 2.3 Basic information about the dataset. ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## Column1 movie_title year place rating vote link duration genre ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 0 The Batman 2022 1 8 434477 /title/tt1877830/ 176 min Action, Crime, Drama ## 2 1 The Northman 2022 2 7.8 40320 /title/tt11138512/ 137 min Action, Adventure, Drama ## 3 2 Everything Everywhere All at Once 2022 3 8.8 31625 /title/tt6710474/ 139 min Action, Adventure, Comedy ## 4 3 KGF: Chapter 2 2022 4 8.9 55 /title/tt10698680/ 168 min Action, Crime, Drama ## 5 4 Spider-Man: No Way Home 2021 5 8.4 86180 /title/tt10872600/ 148 min Action, Adventure, Fantasy ## 6 5 Dune 2021 6 8.1 613257 /title/tt1160419/ 155 min Action, Adventure, Drama ## vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis se ## Column1 1 700 349.50 202.22 349.5 349.50 259.46 0.0 699.0 699.0 0.00 -1.21 7.64 ## movie_title* 2 700 350.50 202.22 350.5 350.50 259.46 1.0 700.0 699.0 0.00 -1.21 7.64 ## year 3 700 1994.15 21.22 2000.0 1996.71 19.27 1920.0 2022.0 102.0 -1.00 0.36 0.80 ## place 4 700 350.50 202.22 350.5 350.50 259.46 1.0 700.0 699.0 0.00 -1.21 7.64 ## rating 5 700 7.97 0.31 7.9 7.94 0.30 7.6 9.3 1.7 1.06 1.11 0.01 ## vote 6 700 38505462.32 97417307.38 530619.0 14118978.57 786450.36 1.0 936662225.0 936662224.0 4.55 27.58 3682028.12 ## link* 7 700 350.50 202.22 350.5 350.50 259.46 1.0 700.0 699.0 0.00 -1.21 7.64 ## duration* 8 700 44.48 36.99 31.5 40.17 27.43 1.0 125.0 124.0 0.94 -0.35 1.40 ## genre* 9 700 84.57 49.17 86.0 84.97 50.41 1.0 173.0 172.0 -0.09 -1.11 1.86 ## [1] 700 9 ## spec_tbl_df [700 x 9] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ Column1 : num [1:700] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... ## $ movie_title: chr [1:700] &quot;The Batman&quot; &quot;The Northman&quot; &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot; &quot;KGF: Chapter 2&quot; ... ## $ year : num [1:700] 2022 2022 2022 2022 2021 ... ## $ place : num [1:700] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ rating : num [1:700] 8 7.8 8.8 8.9 8.4 8.1 8 8.4 8 9.2 ... ## $ vote : num [1:700] 434477 40320 31625 55 86180 ... ## $ link : chr [1:700] &quot;/title/tt1877830/&quot; &quot;/title/tt11138512/&quot; &quot;/title/tt6710474/&quot; &quot;/title/tt10698680/&quot; ... ## $ duration : chr [1:700] &quot;176 min&quot; &quot;137 min&quot; &quot;139 min&quot; &quot;168 min&quot; ... ## $ genre : chr [1:700] &quot;Action, Crime, Drama&quot; &quot;Action, Adventure, Drama&quot; &quot;Action, Adventure, Comedy&quot; &quot;Action, Crime, Drama&quot; ... ## - attr(*, &quot;spec&quot;)= ## .. cols( ## ..

For China website, since we do the translation, there would cause some misunderstandings. Since we retrieve data from website, to figure out the regular expression for each variable would cause some problems. For IMDB, web pages are very different from where the data is on the next page (especially for the movies after place 100th and even 700th). Need to use dynamic web scraping since we are not just retrieve data from the first pages for both websites. For IMDB website, some of the movie place data has missing numerical digits for which would cause problems if not doing the data filling. 2.5 Links https://www.douban.com/doulist/240962/ https://www.douban.com/doulist/243559/ https://www.douban.com/doulist/248893/ https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_1000 "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data Transformation", " Chapter 3 Data Transformation There is so much information on the Internet that a human being can’t master it all in a lifetime. What we need to do is not access to this information but using an extensible way to collect, organize, and analyze it. Imagine you have to pull a large amount of data from websites and you want to do it as quickly as possible. How would you do it without manually going to each website and getting the data? Well, “Web Scraping” is the answer. Web Scraping just makes this job easier and faster. We use python to do the data retrieving from the website. For IMDB: we use the link to get the top 700 movies in the IMDB. First, we analyze the website to determine which data we want. And then we use python to web scrap the data and change them into suitable form over pages, and save data into a csv file. For Douban (China movies website): we find a blogger that will update the list of movies timely, who divides the movies into three categories, high, median, low, the standard is the starring is greater than 8.0, and the number of viewers is at least 2000 people. First, we analyze the website to determine which data we want. And then we use python to retrieve data. Since we retrieve from a China website, during the loading, we also did the translation by googltrans package, even though it might not be accurate as we expected. Finally, we save data into three csv files, we will combine these three file in the analysis part.

Drama seems to be the most popular genre. 2. Compared with other film genres, the number of Drama in the top 700 list is several times or even a dozen times higher than other genres almost every year. 3. In the top 700 list, each genre occupies in the range of [0,18] in each year. 4. The number of films in all genres changed little before 1960, but grew dramatically from the 1990s onward, with significant growth in the number of films in the top five categories of Drama, Comedy, Thriller, Adventure, and Romance.

Click the legend you wand to disappear or appear the data for the genres Infer From this interactive lines plot on Trends of Top 10 Genres from 1920 to 2022 (Douban), we could select different genres to make them hidden or appear, we also derived that that: 1. For both website, Drama is the mainly genre in the movie market in every year. Thie may because some movies would have more than one genre, and Drama would be the most recapitulative type. 2. There are some difference genres of the top 10 genre, however, most of them are the same. 3. We can see that these genres increase withn fluctuation, and there is a rapid drop during the 2019-2020, because of the epidemic, the movie market is almost at standstill. 6.2 Significant difference: Scatter plot Since the size of datasets are not same, we find the same movies contained in both dataset. The scatter plot would give a more intuitional result. X-axis is rating from Douban (doubanR), Y-axis is rating from IMDB (imdbR), the short blue is the regression line between them and abline(black straight line). Above black line, doubanR &lt; imdbR, and below black line, doubanR &gt; imdbR. Interactive plot instructions a. Move your mouse to each points will show out the name of movie, and its rating on both IMDB and Douban b. Move your mouse on the blue line will tell you the position on the doubanR-imdbR coordinate within the range exists data points Infer From this interactive plot, you could see the details by moving mouse over the point, we could find that: 1. There exists a linear relationship between rating of Douban and rating of IMDB Usually, if one rating is high, the other would also have a high rating. Hence, even rating is a very personal thing, however, with the large amount users of Douban and IMDB, the popularity of rating is similar, no matter in CHina or in America. 2. Since our data only contain the rating &gt; 7, thus, for these high rating movies, the Douban always has a higher score than IMDB. This is because the scoring mechanism is different， * IMDB: 10 stars * Douban: 5 stars for a good movie, it is hard to give 10/10, 8/10 maybe already consider as a high score. On the other hand, 4/5, or 5/5 could be easy on Douban. 6.3 Significant difference: Percentile plot To reduce the effect of scoring mechanism, we use percentile rank (the below interactive plot), thus we rank movies by IMDB and Douban respectively, the highest rating is 100, and the lowest is 0, we redraw the plor. The points located between two grey lines (the rank difference is less than 20%) can be regarded as having a small score difference between IMDB and Douban. Interactive plot instructions a. Move your mouse to each points will show out the name of movie, and its percentile rank on both IMDB and Douban b. Move your mouse on the blue line will tell you the position on the doubanR-imdbR coordinate within the range exists data points c. Move your mouse on the grey lines will tell you its slope and intercept. Infer We could observe that (you could see the details by moving mouse over the point): 1. The positive relation still exists, the regression line changes slightly. 2. However, from the regression lines, the rating on two website are similar, there still have some movies, above the top grey line and below the bottom grey line, which have a big difference between two websites, which may cause by the culture, regulations, or other reasons.
